# Metagenomic Viral Analysis Pipeline

## Project Summary
This project analyzes metagenomic sequencing data to identify and characterize viral populations. Starting from raw sequencing reads, the workflow performs quality control, assembly, viral identification, clustering into viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs), and diversity analysis.

## Dataset
- Source: NCBI SRA
- BioSample: SAMN08784165
- Run ID: SRR6996007

## Workflow Overview
1. Quality control and trimming of raw reads
2. Metagenome assembly using MEGAHIT
3. Viral contig identification using VirSorter2
4. Filtering and clustering into vOTUs
5. Genome quality assessment (CheckV)
6. Read mapping and abundance estimation
7. Diversity analysis and visualization

## Key Results
- Total contigs assembled: ~20,000
- Viral contigs identified: 17
- vOTUs identified: 17 (all unique)
- All viral contigs were ≥5 kb
- Viral diversity varied across samples (Shannon + richness metrics)

## Conclusion
This pipeline successfully reconstructed viral sequences from metagenomic data and demonstrated how bioinformatics tools can be combined to move from raw sequencing reads to ecological insights about viral communities.

# Date: 3/12/2026

## Goal
Download sequencing reads from SRA and perform quality control and trimming.

## Workflow Overview

1. Load bioinformatics software environment  
2. Download sequencing reads from SRA  
3. Convert `.sra` file to FASTQ format  
4. Run FastQC on raw reads  
5. Trim adapters and low-quality bases with Trimmomatic  
6. Run FastQC again on trimmed reads  
7. Evaluate quality improvements  

---

## Step 1: Load software environment

Load the Anaconda module on the HPC so that conda and bioinformatics packages are available.

```bash
# navigate to home directory to start the workflow
cd ~

# load the Anaconda module
module load anaconda3
```

---

## Step 2: Create and activate SRA toolkit environment

Create a conda environment containing the SRA toolkit.

```bash
# create environment with SRA tools from bioconda
conda create -n sra_env -c bioconda sra-tools

# activate environment
conda activate sra_env
```

---

## Step 3: Create project directory

Create a directory to hold sequencing data and analysis files.

```bash
# create project directory
mkdir project_fastq

# move into project directory
cd project_fastq
```

---

## Step 4: Download sequencing data from SRA

BioSample accession: **SAMN08784165**  
Run accession: **SRR6996007**

```bash
# download sequencing run from SRA
prefetch SAMN08784165
```

---

## Step 5: Convert SRA file to FASTQ format

Convert the `.sra` file to FASTQ format for downstream analysis.

```bash
# move into directory containing downloaded run
cd SRR6996007

# convert SRA file to FASTQ
fasterq-dump SRR6996007.sra

# compress FASTQ files to save space
gzip *.fastq
```

---

## Step 6: Organize reads

Create directories for raw and trimmed reads.

```bash
# directory for raw sequencing reads
mkdir raw

# directory for trimmed reads
mkdir trimmed

# move FASTQ files into the raw directory
mv SRR6996007/*.fastq.gz raw/
```

---

## Step 7: Run FastQC on raw reads

Run quality control analysis on the raw sequencing reads.

```bash
# start interactive compute session
srun --pty bash

# load FastQC
module load fastqc

# create output directory for FastQC reports
mkdir projectfastqc_out

# run FastQC on raw read files
fastqc -o projectfastqc_out \
raw/SRR6996007.sra_1.fastq.gz \
raw/SRR6996007.sra_2.fastq.gz
```

---

## Step 8: Trim reads with Trimmomatic

Perform adapter removal and quality trimming.

```bash
# load trimmomatic
module load trimmomatic

# run paired-end trimming
trimmomatic PE \
raw/SRR6996007.sra_1.fastq.gz raw/SRR6996007.sra_2.fastq.gz \
trimmed/SRR6996007_R1_paired.fastq.gz trimmed/SRR6996007_R1_unpaired.fastq.gz \
trimmed/SRR6996007_R2_paired.fastq.gz trimmed/SRR6996007_R2_unpaired.fastq.gz \
ILLUMINACLIP:/home/share/apps/trimmomatic/0.39/adapters/TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10 \
SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 \
MINLEN:50
```

---

## Results

### Trimming Statistics

```
Input Read Pairs: 1000988
Both Surviving: 590207 (58.96%)
Forward Only Surviving: 323943 (32.36%)
Reverse Only Surviving: 22658 (2.26%)
Dropped: 64180 (6.41%)
```

Approximately **59% of read pairs remained intact after trimming**, while the remaining reads were removed due to low quality or adapter contamination.

---

## Step 9: Run FastQC on trimmed reads

Evaluate sequence quality after trimming.

```bash
fastqc -o projectfastqc_out \
trimmed/SRR6996007_R1_paired.fastq.gz \
trimmed/SRR6996007_R2_paired.fastq.gz
```

---

## Evaluation of Trimmed Output Files

The raw sequencing reads contained **1,000,988 read pairs**, with lengths ranging from **35–301 bp** and a **GC content of approximately 47%**.

Initial FastQC analysis indicated several quality concerns:

- Per-base sequence quality declined toward the ends of reads.
- Many bases fell into lower quality ranges after approximately **200 bp**.
- Sequence duplication levels were elevated, suggesting repeated reads.

After trimming with **Trimmomatic** using:

- adapter removal (`ILLUMINACLIP`)
- sliding window quality filtering (`SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20`)
- minimum read length (`MINLEN:50`)

the dataset was reduced to **590,207 paired reads**, meaning **58.96% of read pairs survived trimming**.

The trimmed reads ranged from **50–301 bp** and maintained a **GC content of approximately 47%**.

### Notable FastQC observations after trimming

**Per-base sequence quality**

Quality scores were high across most of the read length, with most bases falling in the high-quality (green) range.

**Adapter content**

Adapter contamination was reduced after trimming, indicating that adapter sequences were successfully removed.

**Sequence length distribution**

Trimmed reads showed a range of lengths due to removal of low-quality bases and adapter sequences, with all reads remaining longer than the **50 bp minimum threshold**.

Overall, trimming improved sequencing read quality by removing low-quality regions and adapter contamination, resulting in a cleaner dataset for downstream analysis.

### Why trim sequencing reads?

Trimming removes low-quality bases and adapter contamination, which:

- Improves read accuracy  
- Reduces errors during assembly  
- Prevents artificial inflation of diversity  
- Leads to more reliable downstream analyses  

Without trimming, poor-quality reads can negatively impact assembly and viral detection.

# Date: 3/17/2026

## Goal
Perform metagenome assembly using trimmed paired-end reads with MEGAHIT.

---

## Workflow Overview

1. Confirm project directory structure  
2. Create MEGAHIT environment  
3. Verify trimmed reads  
4. Create and submit SLURM script  
5. Monitor job status and retrieve output  

---

## Step 1: Confirm project directories

Verify that all required directories exist and organize the project structure before running assembly.

```bash
# navigate to project directory
cd project_fastq

# list existing directories
ls
```

Output:

```
assembly  logs  projectfastqc_out  raw  SRR6996007  trimmed
```

Create directories for assembly output and logs:

```bash
mkdir assembly
mkdir logs
```

Create a subdirectory for SLURM scripts:

```bash
cd assembly
mkdir slurmscripts
cd ..
```

Verify final directory structure:

```bash
ls
```

Output:

```
assembly  logs  projectfastqc_out  raw  SRR6996007  trimmed
```

---

## Step 2: Create MEGAHIT environment

Install MEGAHIT using mamba and create a dedicated environment.

```bash
module load mamba

mamba create -y -n megahit-env -c conda-forge -c bioconda megahit

mamba activate megahit-env
```

---

## Step 3: Verify trimmed reads

Confirm that trimmed paired-end reads are present before assembly.

```bash
cd trimmed
ls
```

Output:

```
R1_paired.fastq.gz    R2_paired.fastq.gz
R1_unpaired.fastq.gz  R2_unpaired.fastq.gz
```

---

## Step 4: Create and submit SLURM script

Create the MEGAHIT job script.

```bash
nano megahit_run.sh
```

Submit the job:

```bash
sbatch megahit_run.sh
```

SLURM script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=megahit_SRR6996007
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
#SBATCH --mem=32G

#SBATCH --mail-user=pj288@georgetown.edu
#SBATCH --mail-type=END,FAIL

module load mamba
mamba activate megahit-env

READDIR=/home/pj288/project_fastq/trimmed
READ1=${READDIR}/R1_paired.fastq.gz
READ2=${READDIR}/R2_paired.fastq.gz

OUTDIR=/home/pj288/project_fastq/assembly/megahit_SRR6996007_out

megahit \

  -2 ${READ2} \
  -t ${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK} \
  -o ${OUTDIR}

echo "Done. Contigs should be in: ${OUTDIR}/final.contigs.fa"
```

---

## Step 5: Monitor job and check output

Check if the job is running:

```bash
squeue -u pj288
```

Navigate to the assembly output directory:

```bash
cd /home/pj288/project_fastq/assembly/megahit_SRR6996007_out
ls
```

Output (initial):

```
checkpoints.txt  done  final.contigs.fa  intermediate_contigs  log  options.json
```

---
## Step 6: Install SeqKit for assembly statistics

```bash
module load mamba
mamba install -n megahit-env -c bioconda seqkit
mamba activate megahit-env
```
---

## Results

### Assembly Statistics (MEGAHIT)

Assembly was performed using **MEGAHIT v1.2.9** on trimmed paired-end reads.

```bash
seqkit stats -a final.contigs.fa
```

### Assembly Output Summary

```
file              format  type  num_seqs    sum_len  min_len  avg_len  max_len   Q1   Q2   Q3  sum_gap  N50  N50_num  GC(%)
final.contigs.fa  FASTA   DNA     20,288  9,474,621      204      467  129,544  338  395  476        0  439      958  47.09
```

### Key Metrics

- **Total contigs:** 20,288  
- **Total assembly length:** 9,474,621 bp  
- **Average contig length:** 467 bp  
- **Minimum contig length:** 204 bp  
- **Maximum contig length:** 129,544 bp  
- **N50:** 439 bp  
- **GC content:** 47.09%  

### Interpretation

- The assembly produced **~9.47 Mb of sequence data**, indicating successful reconstruction of genomic fragments from the metagenomic dataset.  
- The relatively **high number of contigs (20k+)** and **moderate N50 (439 bp)** suggest a fragmented assembly, which is typical for:
  - metagenomic samples  
  - complex microbial communities  
  - short-read sequencing data  

- The **maximum contig length (~129 kb)** indicates that some longer genomic regions were successfully assembled.

- The **GC content (~47%)** is consistent with many bacterial genomes, supporting biological plausibility of the assembly.

Overall, the MEGAHIT assembly successfully generated contigs suitable for downstream analyses such as:
- gene prediction  
- taxonomic classification  
- functional annotation

### Why assemble reads?

Assembly reconstructs longer contiguous sequences (contigs) from short sequencing reads, which:

- Enables identification of genes and genomes  
- Is required for tools like VirSorter2  
- Allows detection of viral sequences that cannot be identified from raw reads alone  

Metagenomic assembly is especially important because the data contains mixed microbial communities.

```bash
# no output → job complete
```

---

## Step 8: Check logs

```bash
cd /home/pj288/project_fastq/logs
ls
cat virsorter.<jobID>.err
```

---

## Results

```
## Step 9: Locate VirSorter2 results and count viral contigs

After VirSorter2 finished, navigate to the output directory and inspect the result files.

```bash
cd /home/pj288/project_fastq/virsorter/vs2-SRR6996007
ls
```

Output:

```bash
config.yaml
final-viral-boundary.tsv
final-viral-combined.fa
final-viral-score.tsv
iter-0
log
```

Count the total number of viral contigs:

```bash
grep -c ">" final-viral-combined.fa
```

Output:

```bash
17
```

VirSorter2 identified **17 viral contigs**.

---

## Step 11: Install SeqKit and filter contigs by length

Activate the `megahit-env` environment and install SeqKit:

```bash
module load mamba
mamba activate megahit-env
mamba install -n megahit-env -c bioconda seqkit
```

After installation, remain in the VirSorter2 output directory:

```bash
cd /home/pj288/project_fastq/virsorter/vs2-SRR6996007
```

Count how many viral contigs are at least **5 kb** long:

```bash
seqkit seq -m 5000 final-viral-combined.fa | grep -c ">"
```

Output:

```bash
17
```

Create a filtered FASTA file containing only contigs at least **5 kb** long:

```bash
seqkit seq -m 5000 final-viral-combined.fa > final-viral-combined_min5kb.fa
```

Verify the number of contigs in the filtered file:

```bash
grep -c ">" final-viral-combined_min5kb.fa
```

Output:

```bash
17
```

---

## Interpretation

- VirSorter2 identified **17 total viral contigs**
- Filtering with SeqKit showed that **all 17 viral contigs were at least 5,000 bp long**
- Therefore, no viral contigs were removed during the 5 kb filtering step

The filtered file for downstream analysis is:

```bash
final-viral-combined_min5kb.fa
```
---
## Step 12: Cluster viral contigs into vOTUs with vclust

Create and activate a new environment for vclust:

```bash
module load mamba
mamba create -y -n votu-env -c bioconda -c conda-forge vclust
mamba activate votu-env
```

Verify installation:

```bash
vclust --help | head
```

Run vclust on the filtered viral contigs file:

```bash
cd /home/pj288/project_fastq/virsorter/vs2-SRR6996007
```

Prefilter similar genome pairs:

```bash
vclust prefilter \
  -i final-viral-combined_min5kb.fa \
  -o fltr.txt
```

Align sequences and calculate ANI:

```bash
vclust align \
  -i final-viral-combined_min5kb.fa \
  -o ani.tsv \
  --filter fltr.txt
```

Cluster sequences into vOTUs at 95% ANI:

```bash
vclust cluster \
  -i ani.tsv \
  -o clusters.tsv \
  --ids ani.ids.tsv \
  --metric ani \
  --ani 0.95 \
  --out-repr
```

### Results

The clustering step reported:

- **17 total objects**
- **17 total clusters (including singletons)**

This indicates that none of the viral contigs clustered together at the 95% ANI threshold, so each contig represented its own vOTU.

---

## Step 13: Extract vOTU representative sequences

Generate a list of vOTU seed IDs from the clustering output. Because `clusters.tsv` contains a header row, skip the first line when extracting IDs:

```bash
tail -n +2 clusters.tsv | awk '{print $2}' | sort -u > votu_seeds.txt
```

Switch back to the environment containing SeqKit:

```bash
mamba deactivate
mamba activate megahit-env
```

Extract the representative vOTU sequences:

```bash
seqkit grep -f votu_seeds.txt final-viral-combined_min5kb.fa > votus_final.fna
```

Sanity checks:

```bash
wc -l votu_seeds.txt
grep -c ">" votus_final.fna
```

Output:

```bash
17 votu_seeds.txt
17
```

---

## Interpretation

- VirSorter2 identified **17 viral contigs**
- Filtering confirmed that **all 17 contigs were ≥ 5 kb**
- vclust grouped the sequences into **17 vOTUs**
- Therefore, each viral contig represented a unique viral operational taxonomic unit
- `votus_final.fna` contains the final non-redundant representative viral sequences for downstream analysis

## Why filter contigs ≥ 5 kb?

We filtered viral contigs to include only sequences ≥5,000 bp because:

- Short contigs are more likely to be assembly artifacts or incomplete genomes  
- Viral identification tools (like VirSorter2) are more reliable on longer sequences  
- Many downstream analyses (e.g., vOTU clustering, CheckV) assume sufficiently long contigs  
- This threshold is commonly used in viral metagenomics to improve confidence in biological interpretation  

In this dataset, all viral contigs were already ≥5 kb, so no sequences were removed.

### Why cluster into vOTUs?

Clustering viral contigs into vOTUs reduces redundancy and groups similar viral genomes together.

- 95% ANI threshold approximates species-level grouping  
- Helps standardize viral diversity comparisons  
- Prevents counting nearly identical sequences as separate viruses  

In this dataset, each contig formed its own vOTU, indicating high diversity.

## Conceptual Notes

- vOTUs reduce redundancy and represent viral populations  
- pooled vOTUs increase diversity and improve genome reconstruction  
- mapping identifies viral presence and abundance

## Goal
Calculate alpha diversity metrics from the class vOTU abundance table and visualize viral community patterns using barplots and a heat map.

---

## Workflow Overview

1. Load required R packages  
2. Import the vOTU abundance table as a TSV  
3. Reformat the data into a numeric abundance matrix  
4. Calculate per-sample richness and Shannon diversity  
5. Generate barplots for alpha diversity  
6. Filter vOTUs by TPM abundance  
7. Log-transform TPM values  
8. Generate a clustered heat map of vOTU relative abundance  

---
## STEP 1: Load packages
- Install (once): vegan, pheatmap, RColorBrewer
- Load each session:
  - vegan → diversity metrics
  - pheatmap → heatmap plotting
  - readr → reading TSV files

---

## STEP 2: Import data
- Read TSV file: ClassProject_votus_12367_coverm.tsv
- Keep original column names (important for TPM detection)

---

## STEP 3: Format abundance matrix
- Set Contig column as row names (each row = vOTU)
- Remove Contig column → keep only numeric sample data
- Convert all columns to numeric

Result:
- Rows = vOTUs
- Columns = samples
- Values = abundance (TPM or counts)

---

## STEP 4: Prepare for diversity analysis
- Transpose matrix:
  - Rows → samples
  - Columns → vOTUs
- Remove samples with total abundance = 0

---

## STEP 5: Calculate alpha diversity
- Richness = number of vOTUs per sample
- Shannon = accounts for richness + evenness

Output:
- Data frame with:
  - Sample
  - Richness
  - Shannon

---

## STEP 6: Plot alpha diversity
- Barplot 1: Richness per sample
  - Shows number of detected vOTUs
- Barplot 2: Shannon diversity per sample
  - Shows diversity + distribution balance

Interpretation:
- Higher richness → more vOTUs present
- Higher Shannon → more even + diverse community

---

## STEP 7: Prepare data for heatmap
- Re-read file using read_tsv
- Select only columns ending in "TPM"
- Keep Contig + TPM columns only

Cleaning:
- Remove specific contig: S1k141_26921||full

---

## STEP 8: Filter low-abundance vOTUs
- For each vOTU:
  - Compute max TPM across samples
- Keep only vOTUs where max TPM > threshold (e.g., 10)

Purpose:
- Removes noise
- Focuses on biologically meaningful signals

---

## STEP 9: Build heatmap matrix
- Convert filtered table → numeric matrix
- Set rownames = Contig IDs

---

## STEP 10: Log transform data
- Apply log10(TPM + 1)

Reason:
- Reduces skew
- Improves visualization of differences
- Prevents extreme values from dominating

---

## STEP 11: Generate heatmap
- Cluster rows (vOTUs) → groups similar abundance patterns
- Cluster columns (samples) → groups similar samples
- Use custom color gradient

Heatmap interpretation:
- Rows = vOTUs
- Columns = samples
- Color intensity = relative abundance
- Clusters reveal:
  - Shared viral profiles
  - Sample similarity
  - Dominant vs rare vOTUs

---

## FINAL OUTPUTS
1. Richness barplot (per sample)
2. Shannon diversity barplot (per sample)

# Alpha Diversity + Heatmap (Class R Script)
---

### 1. Load packages
- vegan → diversity calculations
- pheatmap → heatmap visualization
- RColorBrewer → color palettes
- readr → reading TSV files

---

### 2. Import data
- Read in TSV file containing vOTU abundance
- Data structure:
  - First column = Contig (vOTU ID)
  - Remaining columns = sample abundances (TPM)

---

### 3. Format data
- Set Contig column as row names
- Remove Contig column from matrix
- Convert all values to numeric

Result:
- Rows = vOTUs
- Columns = samples

---

### 4. Alpha diversity calculations
- Transpose matrix:
  - Rows = samples
  - Columns = vOTUs
- Remove samples with zero total abundance

Compute:
- Richness (specnumber) → number of vOTUs per sample
- Shannon diversity (diversity) → accounts for richness + evenness

Store results in a data frame (alpha_div)

---

### 5. Plot alpha diversity
- Barplot: Richness per sample
- Barplot: Shannon diversity per sample

Purpose:
- Compare diversity across samples

---

### 6. Heatmap preparation
- Re-read data using read_tsv
- Select only TPM columns
- Keep Contig column for labeling

Cleaning steps:
- Remove specific contig: S1k141_26921||full
- Filter out low-abundance vOTUs using TPM threshold

---

### 7. Heatmap matrix setup
- Convert filtered data to numeric matrix
- Assign row names = Contig IDs

---

### 8. Log transformation
- Apply log10(TPM + 1)

Purpose:
- Normalize skewed abundance values
- Improve visualization

---

### 9. Generate heatmap
- Cluster rows (vOTUs)
- Cluster columns (samples)
- Apply color gradient
